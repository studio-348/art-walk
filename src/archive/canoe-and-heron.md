**August Swinson grew up on the small Mississaugas of Scugog Islan First Nation.**

Early memories of life influenced his work as an illustrator. Swinson remembers nostalgic images of chopping and carrying wood and water, canoeing with his Grandfather or scrambling over rocks with his siblings on the islands that dot the lakes of the Kawarthas. With a career in graphic design, he now spends time in his studio located in Kitchener.

An illustration combining a favourite activity and a favourite bird. You don't have to go far to be on the lake or to see these magnificent birds.
